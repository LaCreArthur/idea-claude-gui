# Fork Status

> **Upstream sync has been abandoned as of January 2026**

## Background

This project started as a fork of [zhukunpenglinyutong/idea-claude-code-gui](https://github.com/zhukunpenglinyutong/idea-claude-code-gui).

As of January 2026, this fork has diverged significantly and upstream sync has been discontinued.

## Key Differences from Upstream

1. **English-only** - Removed i18n infrastructure, all UI is English
2. **Claude-only** - Removed Codex/multi-provider support
3. **Simplified architecture** - Major code cleanup and simplification
4. **Independent SDK management** - Uses `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` directly

## Historical Merge Stats

| Release | Commits | Files Changed | Conflicts | Rate |
|---------|---------|---------------|-----------|------|
| v0.2.2  | 57      | 82            | 15        | 18%  |
| v0.2.3  | 20      | 97            | 7         | 7%   |

Git merges were practical with AI-assisted conflict resolution, but the codebases have diverged too much to continue syncing.
